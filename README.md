# Lab 11 - API test

## Overview

This project is a test of an AWS-based API we made.

## Usage

Once you download this Git repository, run the following command 
in a console/terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

There's no dependencies for Node.js here though.

To run the project easily, you can use the VSCode Live Server 
extension to run a local server for the project. In VSCode, hit
Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command window, and use the command 
"Live Preview: Start Server".
